## Description

In the library, LowbieH is learning the double-ended queue, which is also called deque. He thinks that it is very interesting and invites you to join him. Now there are $n$ empty deques numbered from $1$ to $n$, you need to implement three types of operations that LowbieH asks you.

Type-1: $1\,u\,w\,val$. Insert $val$ to the deque numbered by $u$. ( $w=0$ means that the insertion is done in the front, $w=1$ means that the insertion is done in the rear)

Type-2: $2\,u\,w$. Query the front or the rear element in the deque numbered by $u$ and pop it out. ( $w=0$ means the front, $w=1$ means the rear)

Type-3: $3\,u\,v\,w$. Connect the deque numbered by $v$ to the rear of the deque numbered by $u(u≠v)$. ( $w=0$ means a direct connection, $w=1$ means a reversed connection, that is to say you need to first reverse the deque numbered by $v$ and then connect them) The deque numbered by $v$ will be cleared after the connection.

## Input

**Multiple test cases**. Please process to the **end of file**.

For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n(1≤n≤10^5)$ and $q(1≤q≤10^5)$, denoting the number of the deques and the number of the operations. The following $q$ lines will be the three types of operations that have been explained.

$1≤u,v≤n$, $0≤w≤1$, $1≤val≤10^5$.

It is guaranteed that the total number of operations will not exceed $3∗10^5$.

## Output

Print one line an integer denoting the answer for each type-2 operation. If the deque is empty, then print `−1` instead.

## HINT


The data is **randomly generated**, so you can assume that the expected length of each deque is very small.


You are encouraged to self-study the implementation of **deque**.
